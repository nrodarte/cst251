		<H1> NICHOLAS RODARTE</h1>


<p1> Hello my name is Nicholas Rodarte but I prefer to go by Nick, I am a 22 year old transfer student from San Jose, Ca.
			In my free time I like to hangout with friends playing video games, boardgames or watching movies. Also I enjoy cooking/food, drawing calligraffiti, and listening to music from around the world.
			Some of my favorite artists include french tunisian calligraffiti artist El Seed, bay area icon Grafiti Against The System (GATS), and austrailian graffiti artist Sofles. You really ought to check out their work on youtube!
			 Ive been into graffiti my entire life and just recently I have started to influence my style with components of arabic style calligraphy.
			 Im excited to learn more about writing HTML,CSS, and JavaScript as well as learning to get better at drawing on the computer.
			Thanks for reading!
			 </p1>
