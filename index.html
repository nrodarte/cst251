		<H1> NICHOLAS RODARTE


		<p1> Hello my Name is Nicholas Rodarte but I prefer to go by Nick, I am a 22 year old transfer studen from San Jose.
			In my free time I like to spend time with friends playing games on the computer, cooking, drawing calligraphy, and listening to music from around the world.
			Some of my favorite artists include French Tunisian artist El Seed and Bay Area legend GATS. Ive been into graffiti my entire life and just recently I have started to influence
			my style with components of arabic style calligraphy. Im excited to learn more about writing HTML,CSS, and JavaScript as well as learning to get better at drawing on the computer.
			Thanks for reading!
			 </p1>
