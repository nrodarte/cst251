      <p2> <span class="maintext"> We ran into some issues with changing our font styles on our Css index but all it took was some time spent inspecting on chrome to figure out our syntax errors.
				We also decided to style each paragraph and header seperately as well to try and avoid more errors. </span><p2>

          <p3> <span class="maintext">We styled our text to have increased spacing, I made my headers all caps and a bold arial font, finally I changed the color of the body and the page to be yellow and pink. </span><p3>
