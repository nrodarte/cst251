      <h1>  Challenge:</h1>
      <p1> <span class="maintext"> As we progress the Labs are becoming more intricate and that was definitely the case with this weeks assignmnet.
				Lab 12 had us experiment with centering text and images within block elements and more advanced ways to position elements on the page.
				We were supposed to add a few text areas and images to be centered without the use of just the float/position tag. </span></p1>

      <h2> Problems: </h2>
      <p2> <span class="maintext"> The problems we faced this lab all revolved around stylizing our elements according to the labs requests. We were both confused on how exactly we were supposed to position our text and images to be as directed. For the most part,
			we just went back and forth from inspecting on chrome to altering our css/html code trying to line things up. We were thrown for a loop by the direction about "making all divs 30% wide" but we realized wes only meant the new ones we were adding in.
		I still do not think I had everything right after working more with my partner but I will the the message to Joshue in the main slack channel about what we were not supposed to do did clear some things up. </span><p2>
