      <h2> Problems: </h2>
      <p2> <span class="maintext">  This lab was incredibly difficult for the two of us and all of our challenges were faced while recreating the site.
				We struggled to position everything, we were confused about how to specifically get some of our text to be spaced or oriented correctly. The only thing we had no issue at all with was matching the font and making an visually similar image. </span><p2>

        <div id="results">
          <h3> Results:</h3>
          <p3> <span class="maintext"> We are not 100% satisfied with the result but we do feel proud to say that it looks very visually similar and the composition we ended up with was really not too far off from the original.
					This was a cool lab but a  wake up call for Nick and me, we need more practice orienting block elements.   </span><p3>
