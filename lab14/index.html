      <p1> <span class="maintext"> Lab 14 tasked us to repeat the last lab but this time with a more difficult page to replicate. </span></p1>

    <div id="problems">
      <h2> Problems: </h2>
      <p2> <span class="maintext"> We ran into less problems with this one funny enough, but I want to attribube that to the composition being a little more straightforward.
					 We had an image in the center with color and text placed atop where as in the last one, the large image made things harder to position around. This time we centered the cutout of the couple and just placed everything on top. </span><p2>

        <div id="results">
          <h3> Results:</h3>
          <p3> <span class="maintext"> This one still didnt come out perfect but its very visually similar and the only things I wish I could change, time permitting, would be the vertical text on the left of the page and some sizing issues.
					We placed our image that Nick P. had photoshopped for us and then placed all our divs with text inside to best match the image from the 16 examples... pdf.  </span><p3>
