      <h1> Challenge: </h1>

      <p1> Lab 17 had my partner and I design 3 pages following drawn out layout sketches with each page being styled a different way.
			We created a float page, a standard page and one page using the flexbox layout system.  </p1>

        <h2> Problems: </h2>

        <p2> Problems we ran into revolved around positioning our elements how we wanted them but that was mostly just trial and error.
				We went back and forth from inspecting on chrome to our atom workspace and managed to finally get our pages to match our layouts.
			I decided to use slightly different layouts in each one so that was a challenge but I am happy how they turned out. </p2>

          <h3> Results: </h3>

          <p3>  As a result we had three pages with different layouts, made in different ways. I believe we did not do the flexbox layout totally correct seeing as they did not move to fit the window size perfectly but we were still pleased with how it looked.</p3>
