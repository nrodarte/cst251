<h1> Challenges: </h1>

<p2> Lab 18 tasked me and Nick to create a flexbox layout page as well as introduce a media query rule.
	We are challenged to do so in order to create pages that are mobile browser friendly.

<h2> Problems: </h2>

<p3> We ran into some issues with timing this week so we were unable to turn in the lab in time, for the most part however the process of creating the lab went smoothly.
We struggled a bit with refreshing our memory concering the flexbox model but we refrenced vidoes, W3schools and the lecture to try and position our elements accordingly.
We struggled alot with the media query rule and althought I personally got it in my css to look correct, it was hard to tell if the effect it was having was correct. Or even was it even happeneing, this section confused me.</p3>
</div>






<div>
<h3> Results: </h3>

<p4> Managed to ensure my content would "flex" with the window size, added a series of images: illustrations that I drew for class and I linked some helpful resources. Added my contact info and some links to my page but I felt that I did not complete the media query rule correctly.
I do however feel like I used the meta tag correctly and the web helped me find the right targeting to make it so my page would be mobile friendly. As a whole this lab was a bit of a trainwreck but I felt that I managed to complete most of it correctly. </p4>
