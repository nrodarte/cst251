<p1> Here I have three possible sketches for the home/title page for the webzine. I am partial to the second one on the left.
The gallery combined with pictures/articles would be an eye catching layout.</p1>

<div id="music">

<div id="musicdescription">

<p2> I had the idea to do an artist spotlight page for the music section, and so my sketches reflect on how I would want to see a page describe an up and coming artist.
  Thumbnail images of albums or singles with reviews or descriptions and then a video player running a music video for a "must hear song".

<div id="art">

<img class="art2" src="img/art2.JPG" alt="art2sketch"/>

</div>

<div id="artdescription">

<p3> For the art page I wanted to try and replicate an almost skateboard magazine kind of feel, lots of small pictures with articles describing the art.
Maybe for details regarding the page the artists/articles highlighted could be taken from our peers, asking them which artists are on their radar.</p3>

</div>

<div id="food">

<div id="fooddescription">

<p4> For the food page I kind of had two ideas in mind when doing my sketches. One being a resturant focused page, highlighting specific spots or dishes at a certain resturant;
  the other being focused on recipes and showing off fun foods to make and enjoy. I figured using animations such as images that flip over to the name of the dish when hovered could be a nice touch.</p4>


</div>

<div id="media">

<div id="mediadescription">

<p5> When it came to my media (books and video games) sketches, I wanted to approach it as a review site. Offering books/games of the times and offering our opinions and opinions of our peers. </p5>
