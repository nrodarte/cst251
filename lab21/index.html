      <h1> Challenge: </h1>

      <p1> Lab 21 had me go back over my sketches from lab 20 with my team to get feedback on their design. I was to then turn that feedback into changes in the sketches by creating more refined versions of them. I took these sketches and then created a page on my github to house the pictures as well as list the feedback. </p1>

        <h2> Problems: </h2>

        <p2> I used a prior layout so creating my page was very easy, I ran into some issues making my sketches more detailed but thats mostly attributed to the fact the feedback I recieved was overwhelmingly positive. I had some issues resizing my pictures to look good but I decided to make my favorite sketch the largest. This made using the space on my page easy.</p2>

          <h3> Results: </h3>

          <p3>  As a result I had 3 new updated sketches and a section on my page for feedback. Im very happy with my home page sketch in particular and this has me excited to work on the site with my team!</p3>

          <section class="fourth">
<p5> Feedback: The group liked my idea about using a reactive nav bar that blew up to show images when the links were hovered and so I added that to my sketches. They felt they were a bit too simple so I tried to draw out more inspired layouts. My group also like that I was thinking of color schemes so I tried to put a few ideas into my sketches, but that will be something we have to collectively decide on.
I was a bit late with providing my sketches to them so unfortunately this is all the feedback I had recieved. </p5>
