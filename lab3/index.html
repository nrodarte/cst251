	<h1> FILE STRUCTURE </H1>
		<P1> Lab 3 showed us how to strucure our folders to be orgazined as well as demonstrate how to navigate through them effectively. We made sure our repository on github was organized and had all the proper index files ready for further labs.
			We created a list for our webpage to direct users towards said index files and we also learned how to host an image on our webpage.

		<H2> DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED</H2>
		<P2> My partner and I could have finished much sooner than we did because we ran into an issue with one of our repositories/files. Nick P. was missing his index.html file that was acting as his websites homepage.
		We worked through it on the first day of work but then decided to take a break and consult our classmates via slack. We couldnt figure out where his index file went so we created all new repository for him,
	replaced the files we deleted and then begun work on Lab 3. It was a struggle but was a learning experience none the less. </P2>

		<H3> RESULTS </H3>
		<P3> After working for an hour, we had successfully hosted the images on our site, replaced his index file, created lists on the webpage as well as sort out the files he was missing. We both want to look into better ways to style our webpages but we are
			very happy to have it working finnaly! Attached below, in order, are screenshots of my file strucute, html doc from atom, and the view of my page from the browser.
