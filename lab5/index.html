	<h1> Lab 5 More Html</h1>
	<p1> Lab 5 tasked us to do a few things to our website. We were to create a webpage for this weeks lab report, check our file structures and create a link to take users back to our homepage.
	Nick and I began work on this right after finishing our prievous lab so we were already in a good rythm. This lab served as a great way to check ourselves and our skills while we added some new features to our webpage.</p1>

	<h2> Diffuculties Experienced</h2>
	<p2> This lab ran very smoothly and we basically had no issues writing our code and uploading our images. Every so often we would check each others lines of code, small mistakes were fixed and we finished up work very quickly.
	The only thing that stumped Nick and I was using the image as a link and creating a return to home link at the bottom of the page. We decided to ask after class on monday and then get on zoom to finish up. After seeing Wes's code,
we knew where we messed up and fixed our issues together in no time.</p2>

	<h3> Results</h3>
	<p3> I hosted two images of my art, a link to my instagram in two forms (one hyperlink and one image with a link embeded), and a return to homepage button at the bottom of my screen. The last two features added were a bit confusing but after referencing Wes's code we knew what to do and got everything done painlessly.  </p3>
