		<h1> Lab 6: More Complicated Html </h1>
		<p1> Lab 6 tasked us to use a css style sheet and experiment with creating forms for the first time.
			We started by creating a standard html page, we uploaded an image, and then created a form at the bottom of the page before linking a css document to style the page for us. </p1>

		<h2> Difficulties Experienced </h2>
		<p2> Other than the classic missing slash or aligator in the lines of code, our only real issue was creating the form. We went to slack and saw the post containing the example we worked on during class and this was the refresher we needed.
		Nick and I shared screens and wrote our lines of code following the example and not before long we had everything working.</p2>

		<h3> Results </h3>
		<p3> The page transformed from a black and white disorganized document to something like that looks like its a powerpoint theme tossed on top of text. It was really interesting and probably my favorite thing I have learned so far.
		Its cool how you can create these sheets of information that automatcially stylize the text, images, etc from the document when you refrenced them through code. It almost like putting a filter over a picture that dramatically changes its look.  </h3>
