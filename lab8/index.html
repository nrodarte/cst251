      <h1>  Challenge</h1>
      <p1> <span class="maintext"> Lab 7 tasked Nick and me to create an index.html to use as a webpage for our lab 7 intro to css practice. We labeled the contents of the page using id and class tags and
    	this allowed us to create our very own css stylesheet to apply to the page to stylize our text and image.</span></p1>

    <div id="problems">
      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p2> <span class="maintext"> To begin we created our .html document followed by the css stylesheet. Then we used placeholder text to test how our css code was interacting with the text and our image. This was where we faced the majority of our problems.
    	Thankfully the trick of testing our file locally combined inspecting the elements of the page in dev tools panel allowed us to go piece by piece figuring out what was wrong. We fixed typos, capitalization issues, missing brackets and aligators until things were working as intended.
    All the while Nick and I experimented with different colors, fonts and other possible tags to use. </span><p2>

          <p3> <span class="maintext"> We created a section of the page to be seperate for our text, added background colors, changed font and size. I added a picture and tried to pick colors that I thought would not clash with the picture of my caligram. </span><p3>
