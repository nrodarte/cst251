      <h1>  Challenge</h1>
      <p1> <span class="maintext"> Lab 8 tasked Nick and me to create an index.html to use as a webpage for our lab 8 selectors practice. We labeled the contents of the page using id and class tags as well as adding a few nested tags to experiment with.
    	This allowed us to create another css stylesheet to apply to the page to stylize our text and image.</span></p1>
      </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p2> <span class="maintext"> To begin we created our .html document followed by the css stylesheet. Creating our elements and their designated tags ran smoothly and we only really experienced issues when we started applying our stylesheet.
			Nick's page had an issue where a large section of his main divsion was not being filled in by our set background color and there was a small black box in the lower left hand corner. We went to chrome to inspect and saw there was some text being read/displayed and thats what was causing the issue.
		We tried to check his source code for where this misplaced text was but it just wasnt there. I did some research and saw that if we edited the text thing out in chrome, we could save the changes as its own html doc. We used that doc to replace his current index.html and that resolved the issue.
	However I think something went wrong along the way because when we tried to link our lab 8 page to our github.io homepage Nicks link was referencing the wrong html file or something of the sort because it would not display and instead gave us a 404 error.
	His file was "missing" but we had it in the right place. We tried for an hour to troubleshoot but decided to make an effort to ask Wes on monday after class.</span><p2>

        <div id="results">
          <h3> Results</h3>
          <p3> <span class="maintext"> We created a section of the page to be seperate for our text, used nested selectors, added background colors and a border, changed font and size. I added a picture picked a light green for the background of the text that I thought would look good next to my drawing.
					Unfortunately we couldnt figure our what was wrong with Nicks link to his lab 8 page and as a result have decided to ask about it next class so that we could go back and make it right. </span><p3>
