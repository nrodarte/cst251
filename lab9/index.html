      <h1>  Challenge:</h1>
      <p1> <span class="maintext"> Lab 9 was our intro to block elements and the process of stylizing them with css. We crearted an html doc to use as this page then we cut it into blocks using divisions, classes and ID's.
				 We wrapped all our content in a div, added an image and got to work stylizing.</span></p1>

      <p2> <span class="maintext"> This lab was very straightforward however when we started work, Nick P accidentally saved his new doc over his homepage. We went to github desktop to copy paste the text he lost and we were on our way.
			Other than missing a space/capitlization issue this lab was our smoothest running yet. We ran into some issues with stylization but we kept using inspect on chrome to keep track on what we liked and didnt.  </span><p2>

        <div id="results">
          <h3> Results:</h3>
          <p3> <span class="maintext"> Our page was recolored, margins were added to the text, and image stylized.
						This time I looked at w3 schools for an intersting css style for my image and I saw that if I set the max witdth to a percentage and combined with an auto scaling height, the image would resize itself according to the size of the window.
					I thought this was really cool and decided to stick with it. I think for the most part Nick and I have played it safe when creating our webpages so for further labs I want to start challenging myself more to try experimenting with new tags and css style options. </span><p3>
